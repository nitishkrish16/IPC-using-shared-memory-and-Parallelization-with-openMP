# IPC-using-shared-memory-and-Parallelization-with-openMP

####           The objective of this project is to develop a program that can update shared memory across multiple processes using OpenMP to improve performance. 
#### The program will use shared memory to enable efficient inter-process communication between multiple processes and OpenMP to parallelize the update tasks.

#### The program will be designed to update a shared memory region that contains lines of codes. It will monitor the shared memory region for changes and update the shared memory region with the given options.

#### The update process will be performed by multiple processes running in parallel, with each process responsible for updating a subset of the shared memory data. The update process will involve accessing the shared memory region and modifying the lines of code.

#### The project will be developed in C++ using the OpenMP library for parallelization and shared memory communication. The OpenMP library is used to parallelize the update tasks across multiple threads, improving the performance of the update process.

#### Overall, this project will provide an opportunity to gain experience with inter-process communication using shared memory and parallelization using OpenMP, while also developing a useful tool for shared memory update management that can be used in a variety of contexts.
